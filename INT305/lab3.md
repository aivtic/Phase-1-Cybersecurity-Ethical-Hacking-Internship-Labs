### Strengthening System Security on Linux Servers

### **Objective**:

- To understand and apply fundamental Linux security measures for file systems, network services, remote access, and system monitoring.
- To gain hands-on experience with tools and practices for enhancing system security.

#### **Exercise 1: Locate and Open the `adduser.conf` File**

1. **Find the `adduser.conf` File**:
    
    - The `adduser.conf` file is usually located in `/etc`. Verify its location:
    
        `ls /etc/adduser.conf`
        
2. **Open the File for Review**:
    
    - Use a text editor (e.g., `nano` or `vim`) to open the file:
    
        `sudo nano /etc/adduser.conf`
        
    - Read through the default configuration settings for user creation.

---

#### **Exercise 2: Analyze Key Configuration Parameters**

1. **Default Group Settings**:
    
    - Look for the parameter `GROUP=100`. This defines the default primary group for new users.
    - 
2. **Home Directory Settings**:
    
    - Identify the parameter `DHOME=/home`, specifying where new users' home directories will be created.
3. **Skel Directory**:
    
    - Locate `SKEL=/etc/skel`, which contains default files copied to a new user's home directory.
4. **Default Shell**:
    
    - Check the parameter `DSHELL=/bin/`, which defines the default login shell for new users.
5. **Useful Fields in `adduser.conf`**:
    
    - **FIRST_UID**: The first UID (User ID) to be assigned to new users.
    - **LAST_UID**: The last UID number that can be assigned to regular users.
    - **FIRST_GID**: The first GID (Group ID) to be assigned to a user’s primary group.
    - **LAST_GID**: The last GID number available for regular user groups.
    - **USERGROUPS**: Controls whether to create a user with a group of the same name (yes or no).
    - **HOME**: Specifies the default directory location for user home directories.
    - **LOGIN_SHELL**: Specifies the default login shell for new users (e.g., `/bin/`).

---

#### **Exercise 3: Modify the Configuration**

1. **Change Default Home Directory Location**:
    
    - Modify the `DHOME` value to `/mnt/users` in the `adduser.conf` file. Save the file.
2. **Customize UID and GID Ranges**:
    
    - Change `FIRST_UID` to `2000` and `LAST_UID` to `2999`.
    - Change `FIRST_GID` to `3000` and `LAST_GID` to `3999`.
3. **Disable User-Specific Groups**:
    
    - Set `USERGROUPS=no` in the configuration file.
4. **Add Custom Files to the Skel Directory**:
    
    - Create a custom file in `/etc/skel`:
        
        `echo "Welcome to your new account!" | sudo tee /etc/skel/welcome.txt`
        
5. **Set a Different Default Shell**:
    
    - Change `DSHELL` to `/bin/sh`. Save the file.

---

#### **Exercise 4: Test the Changes**

1. **Create a New User**:
    
    - Use the `adduser` command to create a new user:
        
    `sudo adduser testuser`
        
2. **Verify the Changes**:
    
    - Check the home directory of the new user:
        
    `ls /mnt/users/testuser`
        
    - Confirm that the `welcome.txt` file exists in the home directory.
    - Verify the UID, GID, and default shell for the new user:
        
    `grep testuser /etc/passwd`
        
---

### **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

#### **Scenario**

You are a system administrator managing a shared project folder for a development team. The project folder is shared among three team members: Alice, Bob, and Charlie.

- **Alice**: Needs full read, write, and execute permissions for the folder.
- **Bob**: Can only read files but should not modify or delete them.
- **Charlie**: Needs both read and write permissions but should not delete files.

Your Exercise is to configure the folder's permissions using **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to meet these requirements.

---

### **Objective**

Understand and implement ACLs to assign fine-grained permissions to specific users for a shared directory.

---
#### **Exercise 1: Create the Project Folder and Test Files**

1. Create the project folder:
    
    `sudo mkdir /projects/team_project`
    
2. Create test files in the folder:
    
    `sudo touch /projects/team_project/{file1.txt,file2.txt}`
    
3. Change ownership of the folder to a generic group (e.g., `developers`):
    
    `sudo chown -R root:developers /projects/team_project`
    
4. Set default permissions to allow group access:
    
    `sudo chmod 770 /projects/team_project`
    
---

#### **Exercise 2: Configure ACLs for Each User**

1. **Grant Alice Full Permissions (Read, Write, Execute)**:

    `sudo setfacl -m u:alice:rwx /projects/team_project`
    
2. **Grant Bob Read-Only Permissions**:
    
    `sudo setfacl -m u:bob:rx /projects/team_project`
    
3. **Grant Charlie Read and Write Permissions Without Deletion**:
    
    - To prevent deletion, set the sticky bit and assign specific write permissions:
        
    `sudo chmod +t /projects/team_project sudo setfacl -m u:charlie:rw /projects/team_project`
        
4. **Verify the ACL Settings**:
    
    - Check the ACLs for the directory:
        
    `getfacl /projects/team_project`
        
---

#### **Exercise 3: Test the Permissions**

1. Switch to each user and test their access rights:
    
    - For Alice:
        
        `sudo su - alice cd /projects/team_project echo "Alice can write" > file1.txt`
        
    - For Bob:
        
        `sudo su - bob cd /projects/team_project cat file1.txt echo "Bob can write" >> file1.txt  # This should fail.`
        
    - For Charlie:
        
        `sudo su - charlie cd /projects/team_project echo "Charlie can write" > file2.txt rm file1.txt  # This should fail due to the sticky bit.`
        

---

#### **Exercise 4: Manage Default ACLs**

1. Set default ACLs so new files inherit permissions:

```bash
sudo setfacl -d -m u:alice:rwx /projects/team_project 
sudo setfacl -d -m u:bob:rx /projects/team_project 
sudo setfacl -d -m u:charlie:rw /projects/team_project
```


2. Verify default ACLs:
    
```bash
getfacl /projects/team_project
```

---

### **Deliverables**

1. Output of the `getfacl` command for the folder showing individual permissions.
2. Screenshots or logs showing test results for each user’s access rights.
3. Explanation of how the sticky bit and ACLs work together to meet the requirements.

---

### **Grading Criteria**

1. Correct application of ACLs for Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
2. Proper use of the sticky bit to prevent unauthorized deletion.
3. Clear documentation of test results and outputs.
