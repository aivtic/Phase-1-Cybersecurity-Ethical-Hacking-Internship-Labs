### **Tools Used**
- **Wireshark**: A graphical network protocol analyzer.
- **tshark**: The terminal-based version of Wireshark.

---

### **Prerequisites**
- Completion of Lab 5: Wireshark.
- Basic understanding of networking concepts and protocols.

---

### **Lab Steps**

#### **Step 1: Dissecting Protocols**

1. **TCP Analysis**:
   - Capture some TCP traffic (e.g., browsing a website) using Wireshark.
   - Select a TCP packet and expand the details in the Packet Details Pane.
   - Identify key components such as TCP flags (SYN, ACK, FIN) and sequence numbers.

**Exercise 1**:  
- Describe the purpose of the SYN and ACK flags in the TCP handshake. How do these flags indicate the status of a connection? __________

2. **HTTP Analysis**:
   - Filter the captured traffic to show only HTTP packets using the filter: `http`.
   - Examine the headers of an HTTP request and response.

**Key Headers to Focus On**:
- Request Method (GET, POST, etc.)
- Status Code (200, 404, etc.)
- User-Agent

**Exercise 2**:  
- Choose an HTTP packet and summarize its request method, status code, and any notable headers. What can you infer about the transaction? __________

3. **DNS Analysis**:
   - Capture DNS queries by using the filter: `dns`.
   - Examine the DNS response packets to see the resolved IP addresses for the queried domains.

**Exercise 3**:  
- Identify a DNS query and its corresponding response. What information does the response provide, and how is it structured? __________

#### **Step 2: Creating Custom Filters**

1. **Filter Basics**:
   - Learn about basic filtering syntax in Wireshark.
   - Combine multiple filters using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).

**Examples**:
- Filter for HTTP traffic from a specific IP: `http and ip.src == <source IP>`
- Filter for DNS queries excluding specific domains: `dns and !(dns.qry.name == "<excluded domain>")`

**Exercise 4**:  
- Create a custom filter that captures only TCP traffic from your machine to a specific target IP. Document the filter syntax and the packets captured. __________

2. **Using Filter Expressions**:
   - Utilize the Wireshark display filter expression dialog to construct complex filters.
   - Practice filtering packets based on multiple criteria, such as source/destination IP, protocol type, and port numbers.

**Exercise 5**:  
- Write a filter that captures traffic on a specific port (e.g., HTTP port 80) and analyze the results. What packets were captured? __________

---

#### **Step 3: Identifying Vulnerabilities**

1. **Recognizing Anomalies**:
   - Look for signs of potential vulnerabilities, such as unusual traffic patterns, unencrypted sensitive information, or malicious payloads.

**Common Indicators**:
- Repeated SYN packets (possible SYN flood attack).
- HTTP packets containing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers).

**Exercise 6**:  
- Analyze your capture for any anomalies or indicators of potential vulnerabilities. Document your findings and suggest possible remediation steps. __________

2. **Security Protocols**:
   - Examine traffic from secure protocols (HTTPS) and identify how encryption affects packet analysis.
   - Use the `ssl` filter to analyze SSL/TLS handshake packets.

**Exercise 7**:  
- Capture HTTPS traffic and identify the initial handshake packets. What information is exchanged during this handshake, and how does it contribute to security? __________

---

#### **Step 4: Practical Applications and Reporting**

1. **Conduct a Security Assessment**:
   - Using the knowledge gained from this lab, conduct a mini security assessment on your network traffic.
   - Look for signs of compromised traffic, open ports, or unauthorized access attempts.

**Exercise 8**:  
- Prepare a brief report summarizing your findings during the assessment. Include potential risks and recommended actions. __________

2. **Creating a Capture Report**:
   - Document your analysis steps, findings, and any relevant screenshots or packet details.
   - Prepare a presentation summarizing your lab experience and learnings.

**Exercise 9**:  
- Create a capture report that includes your objectives, methods, key findings, and any recommendations for improving network security. __________

---
